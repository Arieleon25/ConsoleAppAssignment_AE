# ConsoleAppAssignment_AE

The ConsoleAppAssignment_AE project is a console application that involves working with iterations using loops and exception handling. The program prompts the user to input text, performs various operations using loops, and handles exceptions when dividing numbers.

# Project Description

The ConsoleAppAssignment_AE project focuses on utilizing loops, such as for and foreach, to perform operations on arrays and lists. It also demonstrates exception handling using try/catch blocks to handle errors when dividing numbers.

# Instructions

Array Manipulation:

Create a one-dimensional array of strings.

Prompt the user to input some text.

Use a loop to iterate through each string in the array and add the user's text input to the end of each string.

After the loop, create another loop to print each string in the array on a separate line.

Infinite Loop:

Add an infinite loop to your console app.

Save your code but notice that the program doesn't execute properly due to the infinite loop.

Fix Infinite Loop:

Modify the code to fix the infinite loop, ensuring it executes properly.

Loop Comparisons:

Create a loop using the < operator as the comparison to determine whether to continue iterating.

Save and execute your code.

Create another loop using the <= operator as the comparison to determine whether to continue iterating.

Save and execute your code.

List Search:

Create a list of strings where each item in the list is unique.

Ask the user to input text to search for in the list.

Use a loop to iterate through the list and display the index of the list that contains matching text on the screen.

Add code to the loop that notifies the user if they input text that isn't in the list.

Add code to the loop that stops executing once a match has been found.

Duplicate Text Search:

Create a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.

Ask the user to select text to search for in the list.

Create a loop that iterates through the list and displays the indices of the list that contain matching text on the screen.

Add code to the loop that notifies the user if they input text that isn't in the list.

Foreach Loop:

Create a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.

Create a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list.

Display a message showing the string and whether or not it has already appeared in the list.

Division Calculation:

Create a list of integers.

Ask the user for a number to divide each number in the list by.

Write a loop that takes each integer in the list, divides it by the number the user entered, and displays the result on the screen.

Run the code, entering non-zero numbers as the user and observe the displayed results.

Run the code again, entering zero as the number to divide by and note any error messages.

Run the code once more, entering a string as the number to divide by and note any error messages.

Exception Handling:

Wrap the division calculation loop in a try/catch block.

Below and outside of the try/catch block, print a message to indicate the program has emerged from the block and continued execution.

In the catch block, display the error message to the screen.

Test the code by entering various combinations of user input (valid numbers, zero, and a string) to ensure the proper error messages display, and the code after the try/catch block gets executed.
